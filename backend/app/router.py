{
  "domain": "general" | "code" | "math" | "medical",
  "confidence": number from 0 to 1,
  "rationale": "one short sentence",
  "needs_retrieval": boolean

Domain definitions:
- code: programming, software development, debugging, scripts, DevOps, APIs, databases, architecture, or any request to write/fix/review code.
- math: calculations, equations, integrals, derivatives, proofs, statistics, probability, optimization, or quantitative reasoning.
- medical: healthcare, clinical care, symptoms, diagnosis, drugs, treatment, patients, or biomedical topics.
- general: business, HR, policy, document summaries, definitions unrelated to the domains above, casual chat, and everything else.

Few-shot routing examples (classify only; never answer):
User: write a java code for hello world
{"domain":"code","confidence":0.95,"rationale":"The user is asking for Java code.","needs_retrieval":false}

User: write a Python function to sort an array
{"domain":"code","confidence":0.95,"rationale":"The user wants a Python programming function.","needs_retrieval":false}

User: debug this Java program
{"domain":"code","confidence":0.93,"rationale":"The user needs help debugging Java code.","needs_retrieval":false}

User: design a REST API
{"domain":"code","confidence":0.90,"rationale":"The user is asking about API software design.","needs_retrieval":false}

User: calculate the probability of two heads
{"domain":"math","confidence":0.92,"rationale":"The user is asking for a probability calculation.","needs_retrieval":false}

User: solve this differential equation
{"domain":"math","confidence":0.93,"rationale":"The user wants help solving a math equation.","needs_retrieval":false}

User: explain what a primary key is
{"domain":"general","confidence":0.88,"rationale":"The user wants a general database concept explained.","needs_retrieval":false}

User: summarize this company policy
{"domain":"general","confidence":0.90,"rationale":"The user wants a business document summarized.","needs_retrieval":true}

Set needs_retrieval true when the user asks about uploaded/company/internal documents, cites files,
asks to summarize attached material, or likely needs private document context."""
